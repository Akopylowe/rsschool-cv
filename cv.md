## Code examples

Ladies and Gentlemen allow me to present experimental technology :
```es6
const some  = 'Hey'
const what  = n => `${n}, what`
const the   = n => `${n} the`
const hack  = n => `${n} hack?`

some |> what |> the |> hack

The **experimental** pipeline operator |> (currently at stage 1) pipes the value of an expression into a function.
Cool readable.
